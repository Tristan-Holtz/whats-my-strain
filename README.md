### About What's My Strain?

What's My Strain is an app designed to help Medical Marijuana patients as well as cannabis enthusiasts that want to keep track of which strains they are able to use to their benefit and which strains they should avoid in the future. It uses an API to make fetch calls to a back end API and Redux featuring React components and front end testing using Jest and Enzyme, the project took about 5 days.

### Learning Goals
